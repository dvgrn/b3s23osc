#N Block
#O JHC group 1970
#C Example of "*k" symmetry.
#C Used as an eater in many oscillators, too many to list. Also used as
#C a 'rephaser' in P135, 150, 230, and 240 oscillators. In 47.0.0, it acts as
#C an induction coil, preventing a line of 6 from growing new cells.
#C Still life frequency: 1 in 2; the most common object in 16x16 soups;

#N Tub
#O JHC group 1970

#N Eater 1
#O * 1971
#C Also called a fishhook
#C This is a very useful still-life,

#C (see period 46 section), and to modify many other things.  The term
#C "eater" also applies to other still-lifes (and occasionally

#C are the block, eater 2, and eater 3, but
#C many others are sometimes useful, including the tub,
#C ship, and snake.

#C Most known p29 oscillators and some p28s are "pre-pulsar hasslers".
#C Consider a pair of hollow 3x3 squares, with 3 empty columns between them:
#C    ooo...ooo
#C    o.o...o.o
#C    ooo...ooo
#C After 15 generations, this becomes 4 hollow squares:
#C    ooo...ooo
#C    o.o...o.o
#C    ooo...ooo
#C    .........
#C    .........
#C    .........
#C    ooo...ooo
#C    o.o...o.o
#C    ooo...ooo
#C (This goes on to become a p3 "pulsar" in gen 20.)  By repeatedly
#C suppressing 2 of the hollow squares, we obtain oscillators of
#C periods 30 and 60.
#C 
#C It's also possible to suppress 2 of the squares in such a way that
#C the other 2 form in gen 14 instead of 15; this leads to oscillators
#C with periods 28 and 29.  Originally this required 8 pairs of squares
#C supporting each other; DJB found the first p28 ("newshuttle", not
#C included in this collection) in 1973.  Later, several methods were
#C found which use either 1, 2, or 4 mutually supporting pairs.
#C
#C Note that DRH's original collection has more p29s. As many are
#C very similar, they have been trimmed down here.

#N P42 glider shuttle
#O RTW 9/84, MDN ??/94
#C A 2-glider shuttle, using a reaction
#C in which an eater3 and sparks from 2 unixes reflect a pair of
#C gliders.  RTW found a period 66+24n version of this; MDN
#C noticed that period 42 could be achieved by rearranging the
#C unixes.  The unixes can also be replaced by period 5 or 47
#C oscillators, giving periods 50+40n (see P50 section) and 282+376n
#C (see 282.0.0), or by a larger p6 oscillator, giving period
#C 18 (see P18 section).  Also, by a lucky coincidence, the spacing
#C between the gliders allows 2 pairs of gliders to cross using
#C rephasers, giving periods 246+24n (see period 246), 230+40n
#C (see period 230), and 846+376n (not shown).

#N P43 Snark loop
#C Snarks can be used to make an oscillator of any period 43 or above.
#C The Snark was found by Mike Playle in 2013.
#C This particular loop can be made period 86, 172, or 344 by only
#C having 4, 2, or 1 glider present respectively.
#C Also see the period 54 section for the smallest 4-glider snark loop,
#C which has a smaller bounding box but only works for even periods >=54.

#N p60, type -1 toadsucker
#C A "toad hassler" is an oscillator in which a toad is changed by a
#C pair of domino sparks above and below it.  It either moves 1 unit
#C sideways ("toadsucker") or changes its orientation ("toadflipper").
#C Amazingly, there are 5 different positions for the sparks which
#C work; I call them "type -1" through "type 3", depending on the
#C horizontal distance between the top and bottom sparks.  The odd types
#C are toadsuckers; the even ones are toadflippers.  Given a period N
#C oscillator which produces accessible domino sparks once per period,
#C the resulting toad hasslers have period 4N if N is odd, 2N if N is
#C even.  However, there are also some toad hasslers in which the period
#C is smaller, either because the sparks occur more than once per period
#C (see period 58) or because the interaction with the spark is more
#C complicated (see period 56). Any oscillator that mentions
#C "see period 60" uses this mechanism. Toad hassling was apparently
#C first discovered by RTW in 6/84, using sparks from PDs and snackers to
#C give p60 and p36 oscillators.

#N Two p76 pi-heptomino hasslers hassling loaf
#O DER 10/16/21
#C If the hasslers are phased differently, it's period 76.
#C The loaf gets sparked and becomes a semi-common sequence of a pi plus
#C a loaf. The pi gets eaten, while the new loaf gets positioned so that
#C it can be flipped again. Unfortunately, there isn't enough clearance
#C to turn the extra pi into a glider and make a p76 or p152 gun.

#C Extensible to period 2700+1950N.  A p150 gun shoots gliders
#C toward a pair of PDs.  The first is reflected 180 degrees

#C gliders grow a crystal back toward the gun; every 11
#C gliders add another pair of beehives to the crystal.
#C Eventually, an eater stops the growth and the crystal

#N p120-based PRNG
#O DRH 3/21/92
#C Pseudo random number generator,
#C based on an earlier pattern by RWG (a larger
#C version of 40894.0.0).  Produces a sequence of bits b[n],
#C represented by gliders, satisfying the recurrence
#C b[n] = b[n-1] XOR b[n-7].  The sequence has period 127,
#C so the period of the pattern is 120*127.  Increasing the
#C separation between the NW and SE parts by 15N units
#C diagonally changes the 7 above to K=7+N  (N >= -4).  The
#C period of the sequence depends rather erratically on K:

#C This uses a "boat-bit", a reaction in which gliders hitting
#C a snake alternately create and destroy a boat.

#N p46-based PRNG
#C RWG ????, DRH 1/10/95
#C Pseudo random LWSS generator. Produces a sequence of bits b[n],
#C represented by LWSSs, satisfying the recurrence
#C b[n] = b[n-1] EQV b[n-10].  The sequence has period 889,
#C so the period of the pattern is 46*889. Moving the bottom
#C right gun and the reflector at the right edge 46N units
#C farther right changes the 10 above to  K=10+4N  (N>=0).
#C The period of the sequence depends on K as indicated in
#C the description of 15240.0.0.
