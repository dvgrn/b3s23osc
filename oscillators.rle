#N Oscillator stamp collection
#O Dean Hickerson, David Raucci, et al., updated Sep 18, 2022
#C A collection of 1354 oscillators of 157 different periods from 1
#C to 40894. 
#C
#C Notes from Dean Hickerson:
#C The oscillators included here were found/built by many people over
#C many years.  I finished putting the collection together in August 1995,
#C and have worked on this header file off and on since then.  It's still
#C incomplete and probably inaccurate, but I've decided to make it public anyway.
#C Since this collection was built, many new oscillators have been found.
#C Most notably, in 1996 David Buckingham showed how to create tracks
#C built from still-lifes through which Herschels can move.  (See
#C   https://conwaylife.com/ref/lifepage/patterns/bhept/bhept.html
#C for Buckingham's description of this, and
#C   https://conwaylife.com/ref/lifepage/patterns/p1/p1.html
#C for Paul Callahan's discussion of using such conduits to build a stable
#C glider reflector.)  Using Herschel tracks, Buckingham obtained glider
#C guns of all periods >= 62 and oscillators of all periods >= 61.  Further
#C work on Herschel tracks has been done by Buckingham, Paul Callahan,
#C Dieter Leithner, and me; such tracks now give oscillators of all periods
#C >=54, and guns of periods 54, 55, and 56.
#C
#C Building this collection would have been impossible without the help
#C of many people.  In addition to those who found the oscillators, I'd
#C like to thank Alan Hensel, Bill Gosper, Robert Wainwright,
#C Rich Schroeppel, and Jonathan Cooley for helpful suggestions, and
#C Andrew Trevorrow for writing LifeLab, an excellent Macintosh program
#C for building and running Life patterns.  LifeLab's cross-platform
#C successor, Golly, is available as freeware at http://golly.sf.net .

#C Notes from David Raucci:
#C The 2013 discovery of the Snark allowed oscillators of all periods
#C 43 and higher. There are 4 periods for which oscillators are still
#C unknown as of late 2021: 19, 34, 38, and 41. (For period 34,
#C we could use a noninteracting combination of p2 and p17 oscillators,
#C but that's considered trivial.)
#C
#C If you find any errors or can fill in any of the blanks, please
#C let me know. This file has been updated in 2020 and 2021, converting it
#C to a Python program that automatically updates based on a text file input
#C and includes more oscillators that were not known in 1995.

#C
#C Most lines of this header describe particular oscillators.  Each entry
#C begins with an identifying label, of the form "period.row.column";
#C row and column numbers start at zero.  This is followed by the name of
#C the oscillator (if any) in quotation marks, the discoverer and date of
#C discovery (if known) in brackets, and perhaps a comment about the
#C oscillator.  For example:
#C
#C     2.0.0   "blinker"  [JHC 3/70]  Example of "+c*c" symmetry.  This
#C             often occurs in a group of 4, known as a "traffic light",
#C             which arises, for example, from a T-tetromino. 
#C
#C This indicates that the leftmost oscillator in the top row of the period 2
#C section is called a "blinker", and was found by John Conway in March 1970.
#C The notation "+c*c" indicates the symmetry type of the oscillator, which
#C is described later.
#C
#C Many oscillators were found by the following people or groups, so their
#C names are abbreviated in this header:

#C    JHC group  = A group of people working with John Conway in the
#C                 early 1970s, including Conway, S. R. Bourne,
#C                 M. J. T. Guy, and Simon Norton.
#C    MIT group  = A group of people at MIT during the early 1970s,

#C                 Richard Howell, Rici Liknaitzky, Bill Mann,
#C                 Rich Schroeppel, and Michael Speciner.
#C 
#C Also, many of the common oscillators were found independently by many
#C people; this is indicated by an asterisk in the name field.
#C
#C Here are definitions of some terminology and notation used below; for
#C a more extensive glossary, see Stephen Silver's Life Lexicon, at
#C  http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_home.htm 
#C 
#C The 'rotor' consists of all cells in an oscillator which change state.
#C The 'stator' consists of all cells which are alive in all generations.
#C (These terms were introduced by Allan Wechsler in 1994.)
#C
#C An oscillator whose stator is large is often called a 'billiard table';
#C such oscillators are somewhat easier to find than others, so many are
#C included in this collection.
#C
#C The 'period' of an oscillator (or spaceship) is the smallest positive
#C integer P for which generation P of the object is congruent to and in
#C the same orientation as generation 0.  The 'mod' of an oscillator (or
#C spaceship) is the smallest positive integer M for which generation M
#C of the object is congruent to generation 0, but not necessarily in the
#C same orientation.  The quotient q=P/M is always either 1, 2, or 4.  To
#C specify both P and M, we often write "period P.M" or "period P/q".
#C
#C There are 43 types of symmetry that an oscillator can have, taking into
#C account both the symmetry of a single generation and the change of
#C orientation (if any) M generations later.  There are 16 types of
#C symmetry that a pattern can have in a single generation.  Each of these
#C is given a one or two character name, as follows:
#C 
#C    n   no symmetry
#C 
#C    -c  mirror symmetry across a horizontal axis through cell centers
#C    -e  mirror symmetry across a horizontal axis through cell edges
#C 
#C    /   mirror symmetry across one diagonal
#C 
#C    .c  180 degree rotational symmetry about a cell center
#C    .e  180 degree rotational symmetry about a cell edge
#C    .k  180 degree rotational symmetry about a cell corner
#C 
#C    +c  mirror symmetry across horizontal and vertical axes meeting
#C        at a cell center
#C    +e  mirror symmetry across horizontal and vertical axes meeting
#C        at a cell edge
#C    +k  mirror symmetry across horizontal and vertical axes meeting
#C        at a cell corner
#C 
#C    xc  mirror symmetry across 2 diagonals meeting at a cell center
#C    xk  mirror symmetry across 2 diagonals meeting at a cell corner
#C 
#C    rc  90 degree rotational symmetry about a cell center
#C    rk  90 degree rotational symmetry about a cell corner
#C 
#C    *c  8-fold symmetry about a cell center
#C    *k  8-fold symmetry about a cell corner
#C 
#C For a period P/1 object, specifying the symmetry of generation 0 tells
#C us all there is to know about the oscillator's symmetry.  For a period
#C P/2 or P/4 object, we also need to know how gen M is related to gen 0.
#C For the P/2 case, gen M can be either a mirror image of gen 0, a 180
#C degree rotation of it, or a 90 degree rotation of it if the pattern
#C has 180 degree rotational symmetry.  For the P/4 case gen M must be a
#C 90 degree rotation of gen 0.  In any case, if we merge all gens which
#C are multiples of M, the resulting pattern will have more symmetry than
#C the original oscillator.  We describe the complete symmetry class of
#C the oscillator by appending the one or two character description of
#C the union's symmetry to that of gen 0's symmetry.  For example, if
#C gen 0 has 180 degree rotational symmetry about a cell center, and
#C gen M is obtained by reflecting gen 0 across a diagonal, then the
#C union of gens 0 and M is symmetric across both diagonals, so its
#C symmetry class is denoted ".cxc".
#C 
#C The 43 possible symmetry types are:
#C 
#C    period/mod = 1:  nn    -c-c  -e-e  //    .c.c  .e.e  .k.k  +c+c
#C                     +e+e  +k+k  xcxc  xkxk  rcrc  rkrk  *c*c  *k*k
#C 
#C    period/mod = 2:  n-c   n-e   n/    n.c   n.e   n.k
#C                     -c+c  -c+e  -e+e  -e+k
#C                     /xc   /xk
#C                     .c+c  .cxc  .crc  .e+e  .k+k  .kxk  .krk
#C                     +c*c  +k*k  xc*c  xk*k  rc*c  rk*k
#C 
#C    period/mod = 4:  nrc   nrk
#C 
#C The collection includes examples of all of these with mod=1, and many
#C with larger periods.
#C
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C
#C To add an oscillator to oscillators.txt, all you need is the RLE and
#C optional comments. Make sure that there is no more than one #N or #O,
#C and #N comes before #O comes before #C. If the period is 1000 or more,
#C put a percent sign after the exclamation point at the end of the RLE,
#C and the period number after the percent sign.
#C While the file has oscillators sorted by period, the program will handle
#C them correctly even if they are out of order. If a pattern is not a
#C still life or oscillator, it will exclude it from the pattern, but it
#C will take an extra half second to figure this out unless it completely
#C dies first. Oscillators with width above 120 plus the digit width
#C or period >= 1000 with max bounding box expanding after generation 1000
#C are not supported unless the Python code is modified. ROW_WIDTH can be
#C changed at the top of the code to increase the allowed width above 120.
#C
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C
#C Period 1 oscillators are usually called "still-lifes".  Programs
#C written by MDN and others have counted the still-lifes with N cells
#C for small N; the results up to N=20 are shown here:
#C 
#C N    4 5 6 7 8  9 10 11  12  13  14   15   16   17    18    19     20
#C #    2 1 5 4 9 10 25 46 121 240 619 1353 3286 7773 19044 45759 112243
#C 
#C Those with up to 10 bits are included in the stamp collection.  So are
#C some larger ones that either occur naturally in random soups, or are
#C useful, or exemplify symmetry types.  I'm omitting the discoverers and
#C dates for most of the small and naturally occurring ones, since they've
#C been independently discovered many times.
#C
#C Frequencies listed are for 16x16 soups on an infinite grid. Most objects
#C are 10 percent more common on a large torus (AF 2004, 2048x2048), at the
#C expense of the block, which is about 6 percent less common, and the ship,
#C which goes from 1 in 20 to 1 in 90.
#N 1.0.0 Block [JHC group 1970]
#C       Example of "*k" symmetry.
#C       Used as an eater in many oscillators, too many to list. Also used as
#C       a 'rephaser' in P135, 150, 230, and 240 oscillators. In 47.0.0, it acts as
#C       an induction coil, preventing a line of 6 from growing new cells.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 2; the most common object in 16x16 soups;
#C       on a large torus, the blinker is slightly more common.
#C 1.0.1 Tub [JHC group 1970]
#C       Example of "*c" symmetry.
#C       Used as an eater in most p29s, Eureka (P30), and 47.0.0.
#C       A tub can stabilize an exposed line of five. This is usually done when reducing
#C       population is the goal, but this collection is mainly optimized by bounding box,
#C       where snakes are better.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 65
#C 1.0.2 Boat [JHC group 1970]
#C       Example of "/" symmetry.
#C       A glider that hits a snake in the correct position will produce a boat while
#C       leaving the snake intact. See P60 section.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 14
#C 1.0.3 Ship [JHC group 1970]
#C       Example of "xc" symmetry.  Used as an
#C       eater of traffic lights in P24, 36, 44, 48, and 92 oscillators.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 20 in 16x16 soups, but this is because
#C       they form from Herschels. On a large torus, they are 1 in 90.
#C 1.0.4 Beehive [JHC group 1970]
#C       Example of "+e" symmetry.  This
#C       often occurs in a group of 4, known as a "honey farm", which
#C       arises, for example, from a beehive with an extra cell in one
#C       of its corners.
#C       A single beehive is also hassled in a P30 and P35 oscillator.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 4
#C 1.0.5 Aircraft carrier
#C       Example of ".e" symmetry.
#C       One of the 35 hexominoes becomes an aircraft carrier after one generation.
#C       .o..
#C       oooo
#C       ..o.
#C       Despite this, it's still quite rare for a 6-cell pattern, although not as
#C       rare as the snake or the clock.
#C       It's more common in HighLife (B36/S23), as the pi heptomino generates two of them.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 8,000
#C 1.0.6 Barge [JHC group 1970]
#C       Example of "xk" symmetry.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 1,000
#C 1.0.7 Snake [JHC group 1970]
#C       Example of ".k" symmetry.  Used in one P60 oscillator
#C       and 15240.0.0 to convert a glider into a boat, which a
#C       subsequent glider deletes.
#C       Used as a rock in the conduit "Conduit 1" (aka BFx59H), as seen in
#C       78.0.0, 98.0.0, and 190.0.0.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 30,000; rarest 6-bit still life
#C 1.0.8 Long snake
#C       Also called a python, not to be confused with the programming language
#C       Example of ".c" symmetry.
#C       Rarest of the 7-bit still lifes in natural soups, at 1 in 700,000
#C 1.0.9 Long boat [JHC group 1970]
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 200
#C 1.0.10 Loaf [JHC group 1970]
#C        Loaves can be flipped easily; this is part of how eater 3 works. See P8, 106,
#C        and 133. Loaves can be flipped in other ways, too; see baker's dozen (P12),
#C        loaflipflop (P15), one of the P20s, zweiback (P30), and popover (P32).
#C        Still life frequency: 1 in 14
#C 1.0.11 Eater 1 [* 1971]
#C        Also called a fishhook
#C        This is a very useful still-life,
#C        because of its ability to eat gliders (see period 30 section), beehives
#C        (see period 30 section), and lightweight and middleweight spaceships
#C        (see period 46 section), and to modify many other things.  The term
#C        "eater" also applies to other still-lifes (and occasionally
#C        oscillators) that share this ability; the most useful of these
#C        are the block, eater 2, and eater 3, but
#C        many others are sometimes useful, including the tub,
#C        ship, and snake.
#C        Still life frequency: 1 in 5,000
#C        Rarest object that can be the result of a 2-glider collision.

#C        See P60 section for toadsucker/flipper explanation
#C        Toadflippers also exist, but it was omitted to save space.
#C 28.0.3
#C        Most known p29 oscillators and some p28s are "pre-pulsar hasslers".
#C        Consider a pair of hollow 3x3 squares, with 3 empty columns between them:
#C           ooo...ooo
#C           o.o...o.o
#C           ooo...ooo
#C        After 15 generations, this becomes 4 hollow squares:
#C           ooo...ooo
#C           o.o...o.o
#C           ooo...ooo
#C           .........
#C           .........
#C           .........
#C           ooo...ooo
#C           o.o...o.o
#C           ooo...ooo
#C        (This goes on to become a p3 "pulsar" in gen 20.)  By repeatedly
#C        suppressing 2 of the hollow squares, we obtain oscillators of
#C        periods 30 and 60.
#C        
#C        It's also possible to suppress 2 of the squares in such a way that
#C        the other 2 form in gen 14 instead of 15; this leads to oscillators
#C        with periods 28 and 29.  Originally this required 8 pairs of squares
#C        supporting each other; DJB found the first p28 ("newshuttle", not
#C        included in this collection) in 1973.  Later, several methods were
#C        found which use either 1, 2, or 4 mutually supporting pairs.

#C 30.0.0 Queen bee shuttle [RWG 1970]
#C        The central part (the shuttle) reappears, reflected across a vertical
#C        line, in 15 gens, but a beehive is also produced, which

#C        by a block, as shown here, or by an eater in one of two
#C        different positions.
#C        Also see periods 60, 90, 120, 180, 210, and 300. There's also a P26 queen bee

#C        Contains two copies of the P21 honey farm hassler
#C        Unlike pre-pulsar hasslers, this one becomes a full pulsar during
#C        part of the cycle.
#C 42.1.1 P42 glider shuttle [RTW 9/84, MDN ??/94]
#C        A 2-glider shuttle, using a reaction
#C        in which an eater3 and sparks from 2 unixes reflect a pair of
#C        gliders.  RTW found a period 66+24n version of this; MDN
#C        noticed that period 42 could be achieved by rearranging the
#C        unixes.  The unixes can also be replaced by period 5 or 47
#C        oscillators, giving periods 50+40n (see P50 section) and 282+376n
#C        (see 282.0.0), or by a larger p6 oscillator, giving period
#C        18 (see P18 section).  Also, by a lucky coincidence, the spacing
#C        between the gliders allows 2 pairs of gliders to cross using
#C        rephasers, giving periods 246+24n (see period 246), 230+40n
#C        (see period 230), and 846+376n (not shown).
#C 42.1.2 P42 pre-pulsar shuttle
#C        Has been reduced from the original form by using custom p3 sparkers.
#C        A version further reduced by 8 cells exists, but it has a larger
#C        bounding box, so it's not shown here.
#C 42.2.0 P42 honey farm hassler
#C        The custom sparker is period 6.
#C 42.2.1 p42 fumarole hassler [83bismuth38 10/12/21]
#C        Uses the same phase shift as 62.0.0.
#C        Without the fumarole, this is a period-21 domino sparker, although
#C        with low clearance. A traffic light hassler, not in this collection,
#C        can be made with the use of that spark.

#C 43.0.0 Period-43 glider gun [Nico Brown 9/11/22]
#C        The only known period-43 oscillator or gun that doesn't rely
#C        on Snark loops.
#C 43.0.1 P43 Snark loop
#C        Snarks can be used to make an oscillator of any period 43 or above.
#C        The Snark was found by Mike Playle in 2013.
#C        This particular loop can be made period 86, 172, or 344 by only
#C        having 4, 2, or 1 glider present respectively.
#C        Also see the period 54 section for the smallest 4-glider snark loop,

#C 44.0.0 p44 C2 pi-heptomino hassler [mvr 9/6/22]

#C        Also see P88, P132, and P264 sections, which are this oscillator
#C        with period doubler, tripler, and sextupler, respectively.

#C        Exists as both a dimer and a monomer; this is the monomer form
#C        Has been made into a gun, but it's not the smallest of its period.
#C 45.1.0 Period-45 glider gun [MM 4/29/10]
#C        A true period 45 glider gun (stabilized) found by Matthias Merzenich in 2010
#C        with improvements by Adam P. Goucher, Dave Greene and Tanner Jacobi.
#C        The still life shown in three of the four ends is the
#C        smallest way to create the P45 oscillator.
#C        This is no longer the smallest period-45 glider gun; that belongs to
#C        the engine listed as "p45 pi-heptomino hassler #3".
#C 45.1.1 Period 45 glider shuttle
#C        While it may look symmetric, its period is an odd number, so it can't be.

#C 46.0.0 Twin bees shuttle [RWG 1071]
#C        The p46 shuttle, known as "twin bees", was discovered in
#C        1971 by Bill Gosper.  Each end of the shuttle can be stabilized by
#C        either 1 or 2 blocks. If only 1 block is used,
#C        a large spark is produced which can reflect gliders and spaceships
#C        in several ways. Also see periods 92, 138, 184, 230, 276, 690, and 40894.

#C 54.2.0 P54 snark loop
#C        Any snark loop with period under 54 requires 8 gliders instead of 4,

#C        works for even periods. For period 54 specifically, the eaters in the

#C        hitting a snake alternately create and destroy a boat.  This
#C        can be used as a memory device (called a "boat-bit"); see 15240.0.0.
#C 60.1.0 [NDE 5/30/98]
#C        Pre-pulsar hassled by four caterers
#C 60.1.1 p60, type -1 toadsucker
#C        A "toad hassler" is an oscillator in which a toad is changed by a
#C        pair of domino sparks above and below it.  It either moves 1 unit
#C        sideways ("toadsucker") or changes its orientation ("toadflipper").
#C        Amazingly, there are 5 different positions for the sparks which
#C        work; I call them "type -1" through "type 3", depending on the
#C        horizontal distance between the top and bottom sparks.  The odd types
#C        are toadsuckers; the even ones are toadflippers.  Given a period N
#C        oscillator which produces accessible domino sparks once per period,
#C        the resulting toad hasslers have period 4N if N is odd, 2N if N is
#C        even.  However, there are also some toad hasslers in which the period
#C        is smaller, either because the sparks occur more than once per period
#C        (see period 58) or because the interaction with the spark is more
#C        complicated (see period 56). Any oscillator that mentions
#C        "see period 60" uses this mechanism. Toad hassling was apparently
#C        first discovered by RTW in 6/84, using sparks from PDs and snackers to
#C        give p60 and p36 oscillators.

#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 230.0.0 Obnoxious P230 [RWG 5/28/92]
#C         Sparks from a p46 shuttle interact 3 times with sparks from a p5 MW volcano; one
#C         interaction makes a temporary blinker; another makes a temporary glider. 
#C 230.0.1 P230 glider shuttle [DRH 3/19/92 (using early version of toaster); since reduced]
#C         4-glider shuttle with period 230+40n.  See comments for P42 glider shuttle.
#C 230.1.0 P230 glider gun [PC 6/28/94]
#C         Based on 2 LWSS reflections from
#C         p46 oscillators.  In one, the LWSS is turned 90 degrees; in
#C         the other it becomes 2 parallel gliders.

#C 246.0.0 P246 bookend shuttle
#C         Related to the P246 glider gun
#C         A blinker placed correctly can be rephased by two bookend shuttles.
#C         However, this does not double the period, and it is not shown here.

#C 260.0.0 L130 [Entity Valkyrie]
#C         It can be made P520 by including only one Herschel. It cannot be made
#C         P130 though, as the blocks aren't destroyed quickly enough.
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 264.0.0 Sextupled p44 pi-heptomino hassler [dani 7/26/22]
#C         Despite this reaction working as soon as the p44 was discovered,
#C         this period sextupler wasn't found until 2022. You can also see an
#C         alternate stabilization of the p44, which works regardless of the
#C         period multiplier if any. The sextupler also works with the p50
#C         variant of this oscillator, forming a p300 (not shown).
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 270.0.0 P270 glider shuttle [EvinZL 4/10/21]
#C 270.0.1
#C         Every 270 generations, a MWSS is created. However, it cannot
#C         survive; the eater reaction is required for this to remain stable.
#C         Without the glider eater at the bottom, it creates a cycle of 5 escaping,
#C         4 destroyed, repeating.

#C         Contains two copies of Gabriel's p138
#C         Is not the same halfway through the cycle, despite the period

#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 400.0.0 P400 glider loop [RWG 1987]
#C         A glider bounces between 4 centinals.  By expanding the loop and using more than one
#C         glider, oscillators of period 100N can be built for any N.
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 486.0.0 P486 R-pentomino hassler [DER 5/13/21]
#C         Extremely similar to 576.0.0; see its entry for all the similarities.
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 504.0.0 R126 loop
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 552.0.0 [RWG ????, DRH 1/23/92 ]
#C         Glider loop based on the same
#C         reflection as in the p138 section.  Here the ponds are deleted by a
#C         p8 blocker.  The period of the loop can be anything of the
#C         form 138+184n, but the period of the oscillator is 4 times that.
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 576.0.0 p576 R-pentomino hassler [DER 6/9/21]
#C         Compare to the very similar 486.0.0. It's a very high period R-pentomino
#C         hassler with period prime factorization containing only 2s and 3s, it's
#C         a flipper with 180 degree symmetry, it has blocks as suppressors on the top and
#C         bottom and sparkers on the left and right, and it was found by the same
#C         person in the same year using the same search program.
#C         Unrelated to the above: the blocks on the top and bottom are suppressing Herschels.
#C         It can easily be made into a glider gun. Also, the blocks on the left
#C         and right are optional, but if omitted, they'll form as the oscillator
#C         completes its cycle.
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 690.0.0 [DRH 1/3/91]
#C         Sparks from a p46 shuttle interact 6 times with
#C         sparks from a p15 pentadecathlon; one interaction makes a
#C         temporary blinker.


#N Oscillator stamp collection
#O Dean Hickerson, David Raucci, et al., updated Sep 18, 2022
#C A collection of 1354 oscillators of 157 different periods from 1
#C to 40894. 
#C
#C Notes from Dean Hickerson:
#C The oscillators included here were found/built by many people over
#C many years.  I finished putting the collection together in August 1995,
#C and have worked on this header file off and on since then.  It's still
#C incomplete and probably inaccurate, but I've decided to make it public anyway.
#C Since this collection was built, many new oscillators have been found.
#C Most notably, in 1996 David Buckingham showed how to create tracks
#C built from still-lifes through which Herschels can move.  (See
#C   https://conwaylife.com/ref/lifepage/patterns/bhept/bhept.html
#C for Buckingham's description of this, and
#C   https://conwaylife.com/ref/lifepage/patterns/p1/p1.html
#C for Paul Callahan's discussion of using such conduits to build a stable
#C glider reflector.)  Using Herschel tracks, Buckingham obtained glider
#C guns of all periods >= 62 and oscillators of all periods >= 61.  Further
#C work on Herschel tracks has been done by Buckingham, Paul Callahan,
#C Dieter Leithner, and me; such tracks now give oscillators of all periods
#C >=54, and guns of periods 54, 55, and 56.
#C
#C Building this collection would have been impossible without the help
#C of many people.  In addition to those who found the oscillators, I'd
#C like to thank Alan Hensel, Bill Gosper, Robert Wainwright,
#C Rich Schroeppel, and Jonathan Cooley for helpful suggestions, and
#C Andrew Trevorrow for writing LifeLab, an excellent Macintosh program
#C for building and running Life patterns.  LifeLab's cross-platform
#C successor, Golly, is available as freeware at http://golly.sf.net .

#C and list of missing periods updated on 5/8/2009.
#C
#C Notes from David Raucci:
#C The 2013 discovery of the Snark allowed oscillators of all periods
#C 43 and higher. There are 4 periods for which oscillators are still
#C unknown as of late 2021: 19, 34, 38, and 41. (For period 34,
#C we could use a noninteracting combination of p2 and p17 oscillators,
#C but that's considered trivial.)
#C
#C If you find any errors or can fill in any of the blanks, please
#C let me know. This file has been updated in 2020 and 2021, converting it
#C to a Python program that automatically updates based on a text file input
#C and includes more oscillators that were not known in 1995.

#C
#C Most lines of this header describe particular oscillators.  Each entry
#C begins with an identifying label, of the form "period.row.column";
#C row and column numbers start at zero.  This is followed by the name of
#C the oscillator (if any) in quotation marks, the discoverer and date of
#C discovery (if known) in brackets, and perhaps a comment about the
#C oscillator.  For example:
#C
#C     2.0.0   "blinker"  [JHC 3/70]  Example of "+c*c" symmetry.  This
#C             often occurs in a group of 4, known as a "traffic light",
#C             which arises, for example, from a T-tetromino. 
#C
#C This indicates that the leftmost oscillator in the top row of the period 2
#C section is called a "blinker", and was found by John Conway in March 1970.
#C The notation "+c*c" indicates the symmetry type of the oscillator, which
#C is described later.
#C
#C Many oscillators were found by the following people or groups, so their
#C names are abbreviated in this header:

#C    JHC group  = A group of people working with John Conway in the
#C                 early 1970s, including Conway, S. R. Bourne,
#C                 M. J. T. Guy, and Simon Norton.
#C    MIT group  = A group of people at MIT during the early 1970s,
#C                 including Robert April, Michael Beeler, Bill Gosper,
#C                 Richard Howell, Rici Liknaitzky, Bill Mann,
#C                 Rich Schroeppel, and Michael Speciner.
#C 
#C Also, many of the common oscillators were found independently by many
#C people; this is indicated by an asterisk in the name field.
#C
#C Here are definitions of some terminology and notation used below; for
#C a more extensive glossary, see Stephen Silver's Life Lexicon, at
#C  http://www.argentum.freeserve.co.uk/lex_home.htm 
#C 
#C The 'rotor' consists of all cells in an oscillator which change state.
#C The 'stator' consists of all cells which are alive in all generations.
#C (These terms were introduced by Allan Wechsler in 1994.)
#C
#C An oscillator whose stator is large is often called a 'billiard table';
#C such oscillators are somewhat easier to find than others, so many are
#C included in this collection.
#C
#C The 'period' of an oscillator (or spaceship) is the smallest positive
#C integer P for which generation P of the object is congruent to and in
#C the same orientation as generation 0.  The 'mod' of an oscillator (or
#C spaceship) is the smallest positive integer M for which generation M
#C of the object is congruent to generation 0, but not necessarily in the
#C same orientation.  The quotient q=P/M is always either 1, 2, or 4.  To
#C specify both P and M, we often write "period P.M" or "period P/q".
#C
#C There are 43 types of symmetry that an oscillator can have, taking into
#C account both the symmetry of a single generation and the change of
#C orientation (if any) M generations later.  There are 16 types of
#C symmetry that a pattern can have in a single generation.  Each of these
#C is given a one or two character name, as follows:
#C 
#C    n   no symmetry
#C 
#C    -c  mirror symmetry across a horizontal axis through cell centers
#C    -e  mirror symmetry across a horizontal axis through cell edges
#C 
#C    /   mirror symmetry across one diagonal
#C 
#C    .c  180 degree rotational symmetry about a cell center
#C    .e  180 degree rotational symmetry about a cell edge
#C    .k  180 degree rotational symmetry about a cell corner
#C 
#C    +c  mirror symmetry across horizontal and vertical axes meeting
#C        at a cell center
#C    +e  mirror symmetry across horizontal and vertical axes meeting
#C        at a cell edge
#C    +k  mirror symmetry across horizontal and vertical axes meeting
#C        at a cell corner
#C 
#C    xc  mirror symmetry across 2 diagonals meeting at a cell center
#C    xk  mirror symmetry across 2 diagonals meeting at a cell corner
#C 
#C    rc  90 degree rotational symmetry about a cell center
#C    rk  90 degree rotational symmetry about a cell corner
#C 
#C    *c  8-fold symmetry about a cell center
#C    *k  8-fold symmetry about a cell corner
#C 
#C For a period P/1 object, specifying the symmetry of generation 0 tells
#C us all there is to know about the oscillator's symmetry.  For a period
#C P/2 or P/4 object, we also need to know how gen M is related to gen 0.
#C For the P/2 case, gen M can be either a mirror image of gen 0, a 180
#C degree rotation of it, or a 90 degree rotation of it if the pattern
#C has 180 degree rotational symmetry.  For the P/4 case gen M must be a
#C 90 degree rotation of gen 0.  In any case, if we merge all gens which
#C are multiples of M, the resulting pattern will have more symmetry than
#C the original oscillator.  We describe the complete symmetry class of
#C the oscillator by appending the one or two character description of
#C the union's symmetry to that of gen 0's symmetry.  For example, if
#C gen 0 has 180 degree rotational symmetry about a cell center, and
#C gen M is obtained by reflecting gen 0 across a diagonal, then the
#C union of gens 0 and M is symmetric across both diagonals, so its
#C symmetry class is denoted ".cxc".
#C 
#C The 43 possible symmetry types are:
#C 
#C    period/mod = 1:  nn    -c-c  -e-e  //    .c.c  .e.e  .k.k  +c+c
#C                     +e+e  +k+k  xcxc  xkxk  rcrc  rkrk  *c*c  *k*k
#C 
#C    period/mod = 2:  n-c   n-e   n/    n.c   n.e   n.k
#C                     -c+c  -c+e  -e+e  -e+k
#C                     /xc   /xk
#C                     .c+c  .cxc  .crc  .e+e  .k+k  .kxk  .krk
#C                     +c*c  +k*k  xc*c  xk*k  rc*c  rk*k
#C 
#C    period/mod = 4:  nrc   nrk
#C 
#C The collection includes examples of all of these with mod=1, and many
#C with larger periods.
#C
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C
#C To add an oscillator to oscillators.txt, all you need is the RLE and
#C optional comments. Make sure that there is no more than one #N or #O,
#C and #N comes before #O comes before #C. If the period is 1000 or more,
#C put a percent sign after the exclamation point at the end of the RLE,
#C and the period number after the percent sign.
#C While the file has oscillators sorted by period, the program will handle
#C them correctly even if they are out of order. If a pattern is not a
#C still life or oscillator, it will exclude it from the pattern, but it
#C will take an extra half second to figure this out unless it completely
#C dies first. Oscillators with width above 120 plus the digit width
#C or period >= 1000 with max bounding box expanding after generation 1000
#C are not supported unless the Python code is modified. ROW_WIDTH can be
#C changed at the top of the code to increase the allowed width above 120.
#C
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C
#C Period 1 oscillators are usually called "still-lifes".  Programs
#C written by MDN and others have counted the still-lifes with N cells
#C for small N; the results up to N=20 are shown here:
#C 
#C N    4 5 6 7 8  9 10 11  12  13  14   15   16   17    18    19     20
#C #    2 1 5 4 9 10 25 46 121 240 619 1353 3286 7773 19044 45759 112243
#C 
#C Those with up to 10 bits are included in the stamp collection.  So are
#C some larger ones that either occur naturally in random soups, or are
#C useful, or exemplify symmetry types.  I'm omitting the discoverers and
#C dates for most of the small and naturally occurring ones, since they've
#C been independently discovered many times.
#C
#C Frequencies listed are for 16x16 soups on an infinite grid. Most objects
#C are 10 percent more common on a large torus (AF 2004, 2048x2048), at the
#C expense of the block, which is about 6 percent less common, and the ship,
#C which goes from 1 in 20 to 1 in 90.
#N 1.0.0 Block [JHC group 1970]
#C       Example of "*k" symmetry.
#C       Used as an eater in many oscillators, too many to list. Also used as
#C       a 'rephaser' in P135, 150, 230, and 240 oscillators. In 47.0.0, it acts as
#C       an induction coil, preventing a line of 6 from growing new cells.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 2; the most common object in 16x16 soups;
#C       on a large torus, the blinker is slightly more common.
#C 1.0.1 Tub [JHC group 1970]
#C       Example of "*c" symmetry.
#C       Used as an eater in most p29s, Eureka (P30), and 47.0.0.
#C       A tub can stabilize an exposed line of five. This is usually done when reducing
#C       population is the goal, but this collection is mainly optimized by bounding box,
#C       where snakes are better.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 65
#C 1.0.2 Boat [JHC group 1970]
#C       Example of "/" symmetry.
#C       A glider that hits a snake in the correct position will produce a boat while
#C       leaving the snake intact. See P60 section.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 14
#C 1.0.3 Ship [JHC group 1970]
#C       Example of "xc" symmetry.  Used as an
#C       eater of traffic lights in P24, 36, 44, 48, and 92 oscillators.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 20 in 16x16 soups, but this is because
#C       they form from Herschels. On a large torus, they are 1 in 90.
#C 1.0.4 Beehive [JHC group 1970]
#C       Example of "+e" symmetry.  This
#C       often occurs in a group of 4, known as a "honey farm", which
#C       arises, for example, from a beehive with an extra cell in one
#C       of its corners.
#C       A single beehive is also hassled in a P30 and P35 oscillator.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 4
#C 1.0.5 Aircraft carrier
#C       Example of ".e" symmetry.
#C       One of the 35 hexominoes becomes an aircraft carrier after one generation.
#C       .o..
#C       oooo
#C       ..o.
#C       Despite this, it's still quite rare for a 6-cell pattern, although not as
#C       rare as the snake or the clock.
#C       It's more common in HighLife (B36/S23), as the pi heptomino generates two of them.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 8,000
#C 1.0.6 Barge [JHC group 1970]
#C       Example of "xk" symmetry.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 1,000
#C 1.0.7 Snake [JHC group 1970]
#C       Example of ".k" symmetry.  Used in one P60 oscillator
#C       and 15240.0.0 to convert a glider into a boat, which a
#C       subsequent glider deletes.
#C       Used as a rock in the conduit "Conduit 1" (aka BFx59H), as seen in
#C       78.0.0, 98.0.0, and 190.0.0.
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 30,000; rarest 6-bit still life
#C 1.0.8 Long snake
#C       Also called a python, not to be confused with the programming language
#C       Example of ".c" symmetry.
#C       Rarest of the 7-bit still lifes in natural soups, at 1 in 700,000
#C 1.0.9 Long boat [JHC group 1970]
#C       Still life frequency: 1 in 200
#C 1.0.10 Loaf [JHC group 1970]
#C        Loaves can be flipped easily; this is part of how eater 3 works. See P8, 106,
#C        and 133. Loaves can be flipped in other ways, too; see baker's dozen (P12),
#C        loaflipflop (P15), one of the P20s, zweiback (P30), and popover (P32).
#C        Still life frequency: 1 in 14
#C 1.0.11 Eater 1 [* 1971]
#C        Also called a fishhook
#C        This is a very useful still-life,
#C        because of its ability to eat gliders (see period 30 section), beehives
#C        (see period 30 section), and lightweight and middleweight spaceships
#C        (see period 46 section), and to modify many other things.  The term
#C        "eater" also applies to other still-lifes (and occasionally
#C        oscillators) that share this ability; the most useful of these
#C        are the block, eater 2, and eater 3, but
#C        many others are sometimes useful, including the tub,
#C        ship, and snake.
#C        Still life frequency: 1 in 5,000
#C        Rarest object that can be the result of a 2-glider collision.
#C 1.0.12 Long ship [JHC group 1970]
#C        Still life frequency: 1 in 20,000
#C 1.0.13 Very long snake
#C        Still life frequency: 1 in 2M
#C 1.0.14 Pond
#C        Still life frequency: 1 in 70

#C        See P60 section for toadsucker/flipper explanation
#C        Toadflippers also exist, but it was omitted to save space.
#C 28.0.3
#C        Most known p29 oscillators and some p28s are "pre-pulsar hasslers".
#C        Consider a pair of hollow 3x3 squares, with 3 empty columns between them:
#C           ooo...ooo
#C           o.o...o.o
#C           ooo...ooo
#C        After 15 generations, this becomes 4 hollow squares:
#C           ooo...ooo
#C           o.o...o.o
#C           ooo...ooo
#C           .........
#C           .........
#C           .........
#C           ooo...ooo
#C           o.o...o.o
#C           ooo...ooo
#C        (This goes on to become a p3 "pulsar" in gen 20.)  By repeatedly
#C        suppressing 2 of the hollow squares, we obtain oscillators of
#C        periods 30 and 60.
#C        
#C        It's also possible to suppress 2 of the squares in such a way that
#C        the other 2 form in gen 14 instead of 15; this leads to oscillators
#C        with periods 28 and 29.  Originally this required 8 pairs of squares
#C        supporting each other; DJB found the first p28 ("newshuttle", not
#C        included in this collection) in 1973.  Later, several methods were
#C        found which use either 1, 2, or 4 mutually supporting pairs.
#C        
#C        Note that DRH's original collection has more p29s. As many are
#C        very similar, they have been trimmed down here.

#C        A 2-glider shuttle, using a reaction
#C        in which an eater3 and sparks from 2 unixes reflect a pair of
#C        gliders.  RTW found a period 66+24n version of this; MDN
#C        noticed that period 42 could be achieved by rearranging the
#C        unixes.  The unixes can also be replaced by period 5 or 47
#C        oscillators, giving periods 50+40n (see P50 section) and 282+376n
#C        (see 282.0.0), or by a larger p6 oscillator, giving period
#C        18 (see P18 section).  Also, by a lucky coincidence, the spacing
#C        between the gliders allows 2 pairs of gliders to cross using
#C        rephasers, giving periods 246+24n (see period 246), 230+40n

#C        on Snark loops.
#C 43.0.1 P43 Snark loop
#C        Snarks can be used to make an oscillator of any period 43 or above.
#C        The Snark was found by Mike Playle in 2013.
#C        This particular loop can be made period 86, 172, or 344 by only
#C        having 4, 2, or 1 glider present respectively.
#C        Also see the period 54 section for the smallest 4-glider snark loop,

#C 45.1.0 Period-45 glider gun [MM 4/29/10]
#C        A true period 45 glider gun (stabilized) found by Matthias Merzenich in 2010
#C        with improvements by Adam P. Goucher, Dave Greene and Tanner Jacobi.
#C        The still life shown in three of the four ends is the

#C 54.1.2 Two p18 LOM sparkers hassling loaf [DER 10/14/21]
#C        If the sparkers are within 5 phases of each other, it's period 36.
#C        If they are 6 to 8 phases apart, it fails. Only if they are in

#C 54.2.0 P54 snark loop
#C        Any snark loop with period under 54 requires 8 gliders instead of 4,
#C        increasing its size. The 4-glider version of the snark loop only
#C        works for even periods. For period 54 specifically, the eaters in the
#C        center would react with each other, so a single still life combining
#C        the four eaters is needed.

#C 60.1.0 [NDE 5/30/98]
#C        Pre-pulsar hassled by four caterers
#C 60.1.1 p60, type -1 toadsucker
#C        A "toad hassler" is an oscillator in which a toad is changed by a
#C        pair of domino sparks above and below it.  It either moves 1 unit
#C        sideways ("toadsucker") or changes its orientation ("toadflipper").
#C        Amazingly, there are 5 different positions for the sparks which
#C        work; I call them "type -1" through "type 3", depending on the
#C        horizontal distance between the top and bottom sparks.  The odd types
#C        are toadsuckers; the even ones are toadflippers.  Given a period N
#C        oscillator which produces accessible domino sparks once per period,
#C        the resulting toad hasslers have period 4N if N is odd, 2N if N is
#C        even.  However, there are also some toad hasslers in which the period
#C        is smaller, either because the sparks occur more than once per period
#C        (see period 58) or because the interaction with the spark is more
#C        complicated (see period 56). Any oscillator that mentions
#C        "see period 60" uses this mechanism. Toad hassling was apparently
#C        first discovered by RTW in 6/84, using sparks from PDs and snackers to
#C        give p60 and p36 oscillators.

#C 168.0.1 Elusive p168 [iNoMed 9/12/22 based on a partial by DER]
#C         Named because it existed as a partial for so long and
#C         no set of sparkers seemed to work for both pairs of sides.

#C 184.0.0 Period 184 glider gun [David Buckingham, 07/96]
#C         Output suppressed
#C 184.0.1 P184 glider shuttle [DRH 1/24/92]
#C         Glider shuttle based on 180 degree reflection: a
#C         p46 spark turns the glider into a block; the next spark turns
#C         it back into a glider.  The period can be anything of the
#C         form 184+92n.  Also see period 276.

#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 188.0.0 Pseudo p94 gun [DJB,RCS,PC 7/11/94]
#C         A pre-honey farm
#C         interacts with an eater and a block, emitting a glider,
#C         creating a traffic light, and forming another pre-honey farm
#C         47 gens later; this reaction is called "AK47".  The new
#C         pre-h.f. interacts with another eater and block to recreate
#C         the original configuration.  Unfortunately, the 2 traffic
#C         lights must be suppressed in order to make the process repeat
#C         every 94 gens.  This reaction was found independently by DJB
#C         and RCS and was known for years before PC found a period 4
#C         oscillator which could suppress the traffic lights.  (A true
#C         p94 gun was built by DRH in 6/90, using 36 AK47s.)

#C 196.0.0 P196 pi-heptomino hassler [Partial by David Raucci 6/2/21, completed by praosylen the same day]
#C         This oscillator clearly shows the reason why long boats are more
#C         common than barges despite having an extra cell.
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 199.0.0 84P199 [mvr, LJK 7/7/22, reduced by iNoMed the same day]
#C         The smallest known p199 by population, and the highest prime period
#C         oscillator not dependent on glider or signal loops.
#C         One of the few known prime-period oscillators above period 37,
#C         the others being 47, 71, 83, and 127.
#C         Found using symmetric CatForce, then catalysts reduced.

#C         Uses two boojum reflectors
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 230.0.0 Obnoxious P230 [RWG 5/28/92]
#C         Sparks from a p46 shuttle interact 3 times with sparks from a p5 MW volcano; one
#C         interaction makes a temporary blinker; another makes a temporary glider. 
#C 230.0.1 P230 glider shuttle [DRH 3/19/92 (using early version of toaster); since reduced]
#C         4-glider shuttle with period 230+40n.  See comments for P42 glider shuttle.
#C 230.1.0 P230 glider gun [PC 6/28/94]
#C         Based on 2 LWSS reflections from
#C         p46 oscillators.  In one, the LWSS is turned 90 degrees; in
#C         the other it becomes 2 parallel gliders.

#C 240.0.0 P240 glider shuttle
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 246.0.0 P246 bookend shuttle
#C         Related to the P246 glider gun
#C         A blinker placed correctly can be rephased by two bookend shuttles.
#C         However, this does not double the period, and it is not shown here.
#C 246.0.1 P246 glider shuttle [DRH 11/89 (p270+24n), 4/92 (p246)]
#C         2-glider shuttle with period 246+24n.  See comments for P42 glider shuttle.
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 260.0.0 L130 [Entity Valkyrie]
#C         It can be made P520 by including only one Herschel. It cannot be made
#C         P130 though, as the blocks aren't destroyed quickly enough.
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 264.0.0 Sextupled p44 pi-heptomino hassler [dani 7/26/22]
#C         Despite this reaction working as soon as the p44 was discovered,
#C         this period sextupler wasn't found until 2022. You can also see an
#C         alternate stabilization of the p44, which works regardless of the
#C         period multiplier if any. The sextupler also works with the p50
#C         variant of this oscillator, forming a p300 (not shown).
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 270.0.0 P270 glider shuttle [EvinZL 4/10/21]
#C 270.0.1
#C         Every 270 generations, a MWSS is created. However, it cannot
#C         survive; the eater reaction is required for this to remain stable.
#C         Without the glider eater at the bottom, it creates a cycle of 5 escaping,
#C         4 destroyed, repeating.
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 276.0.0 P276 glider shuttle [DRH 1/24/92]
#C         Glider shuttle based on the same reflection as in period 184.  Also see period 90.
#C 276.1.0 4-barrelled p276 glider gun [DJB before 11/92]
#C 276.1.1 [NB, 11/9/10]
#C         Contains two copies of Gabriel's p138
#C         Is not the same halfway through the cycle, despite the period
#C         being two P138 cycles.
#C         The highest-period oscillator in this collection with volatility 1.

#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 400.0.0 P400 glider loop [RWG 1987]
#C         A glider bounces between 4 centinals.  By expanding the loop and using more than one
#C         glider, oscillators of period 100N can be built for any N.
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 486.0.0 P486 R-pentomino hassler [DER 5/13/21]
#C         Extremely similar to 576.0.0; see its entry for all the similarities.
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 504.0.0 R126 loop
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 552.0.0 [RWG ????, DRH 1/23/92 ]
#C         Glider loop based on the same
#C         reflection as in the p138 section.  Here the ponds are deleted by a
#C         p8 blocker.  The period of the loop can be anything of the
#C         form 138+184n, but the period of the oscillator is 4 times that.
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 576.0.0 p576 R-pentomino hassler [DER 6/9/21]
#C         Compare to the very similar 486.0.0. It's a very high period R-pentomino
#C         hassler with period prime factorization containing only 2s and 3s, it's
#C         a flipper with 180 degree symmetry, it has blocks as suppressors on the top and
#C         bottom and sparkers on the left and right, and it was found by the same
#C         person in the same year using the same search program.
#C         Unrelated to the above: the blocks on the top and bottom are suppressing Herschels.
#C         It can easily be made into a glider gun. Also, the blocks on the left
#C         and right are optional, but if omitted, they'll form as the oscillator
#C         completes its cycle.
#C ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#C 690.0.0 [DRH 1/3/91]
#C         Sparks from a p46 shuttle interact 6 times with
#C         sparks from a p15 pentadecathlon; one interaction makes a
#C         temporary blinker.
